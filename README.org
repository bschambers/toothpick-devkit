* Usage
** Introduction

Run the devkit app with:

 $ gradlew run

On running the devkit app a demonstration program starts running immediately.

Press ~ESC~ to open the main menu.

** Menu Controls
ESC = activate/deactivate menu
ENTER = select menu item
BACKSPACE = back to parent menu
UP/DOWN = previous/next menu item
LEFT/RIGHT = decrement/increment value or toggle boolean value
h = hide/show menu (without deactivating it)

** Default Player Controls
*** PLAYER 1:
Q/A = UP/DOWN
W/E = LEFT/RIGHT
Z = ACTION

** TPEditor

When editor-mode is activated, control handles will appear on every actor which
allow basic manipulations to be done interactively.

Left-click and drag on either the position handle or the inertia handle to
change it.

Angle-inertia can be changed by holding ~SHIFT~ and then left-click and drag the
position handle up or down.

You can select multiple actors at once by dragging the rectangular selection
area - just left-click and drag, making sure that you don't begin on any
actor-control handle.

When you have multiple actors selected then dragging the control-handle of one
actor will affect all selected actors likewise.
